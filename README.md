# noob-try
29/1/23-I made this after a senior told me to attempt making small projects. This could be improved on for sure, as I have only used my current limited, beginner knowledge in C++
Made under 4 hours.


4/2/23-Put a lttle changes made the code shorter and tried not to using too many repeating functions as adviced, still the code isn't perfect and obviously can be optimised and bettered in many ways that my beginner mind is unaware of. 
Changes done in a rushed 1 hour. :)
